## Contribute

- Use composition as much as possible, this is the most scalable pattern to build complex components. 
- Use context for shared state / prop drilling when things are getting complicated. 
- Make sure `pnpm build` succeeds before creating a pull request
- Create your component under `registry`. Add documentation under `app/page.tsx`. Extend `registry.json` so shadcn CLI can find it.
